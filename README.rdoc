=Welcome to RAD (Ruby Arduino Development)

RAD is a framework for programming the Arduino physcial computing platform using Ruby. RAD converts Ruby scripts written using a set of Rails-like conventions and helpers into C source code which can be compiled and run on the Arduino microcontroller. It also provides a set of Rake tasks for automating the compilation and upload process. 

For a full introduction see http://rad.rubyforge.org

==Development Information

This is a development version of RAD. At the moment the this version is not working and in full redesign. To support this redesign read the TODO file.

Build gemspec:

 rake gemspec

Build package:

 rake build

==Documentation

The main documentation is here: ArduinoSketch.

See also the Arduino Software reference: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage

==Examples

See the examples directory for lots of examples of RAD in action

The atduskgreg/rad wiki also contains a growing library of examples and hardware tutorials:

==Getting Started

To install the edge gem:

 # Update to RubyGems 1.2.0 before proceeding!
 $ gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org (you only have to do this once)
 $ sudo gem install madrona-rad

A very old and feature poor (though slightly more 'stable' RAD) is available from RubyGems:

 $ sudo gem install rad

Run the rad command to create a new project:

 $ rad my_project

Write a sketch that will blink a single LED every 500ms:

  class MyProject < ArduinoSketch
  	output_pin 13, :as => led
  	
  	def loop
  		blink led, 500
  	end
  end

Attach your Arduino and use rake to compile and upload your sketch:

 $ rake make:upload

==Installing the Arduino Software

Installing RAD and the Arduino software on Linux can be a little more difficult than on OS X. Thankfully, the RAD command line tool can help. Run:

    $ rad install arduino

And RAD will do its best to get the Arduino software installed on your system.

   For OS X, Arduino should be installed in your applications directory -- install the intel or power pc drivers in /drivers
